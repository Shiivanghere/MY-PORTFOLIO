            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Hello! I am Shivang Sharma, an Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) student at Ajay Kumar Garg Engineering College, where I achieved a 9.3 SGPA in my first semester and a 9.0 SGPA in my second semester. With a strong academic foundation, I am driven by a passion for web development and problem-solving. My technical skills span HTML, CSS, JavaScript and C++ allowing me to create dynamic, interactive, and responsive web applications. I am particularly focused on crafting user-centered experiences that blend functionality with design, showcasing my ability to bridge complex technical concepts with practical, real-world applications. My journey in tech is defined by a commitment to continuous learning and innovation, pushing me to take on projects that challenge my skills and expand my capabilities.</p>
            <p>Beyond the technical realm, I am also a dedicated taekwondo athlete and an avid sports enthusiast, experiences that have taught me resilience, discipline, and the value of teamwork. These qualities fuel my approach to collaborative projects and ensure I bring a well-rounded perspective to problem-solving. I am excited about leveraging my technical skills and athletic mindset to tackle real-world challenges in the tech industry. My portfolio showcases projects that reflect my dedication to building impactful, user-friendly solutionsâ€”like my recent HTML and CSS project, now live on Vercel, which highlights my focus on clean, responsive design. I look forward to connecting, learning, and creating innovative solutions that make a difference.</p>
